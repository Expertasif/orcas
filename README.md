As you know , Orcas can learn. I made a system that can recognize and learn human faces then cluster your images by them.
I think this is the point of subscription.

They are so beautiful :smile:

> Though the details were less publicized in the media, a 2001 experiment published in Behavioural Processes revealed the self-reflective nature of orcas (killer whales). Using the same style of mirror test as with Bottlenose dolphins, orcas did indeed show signs of "contingency checking" in the mirror, reacting to the mark as if they expected their image to look different. Some signs of self awareness were also seen in false killer whales, and the researches suggested that they appear to possess the cognitive ability for it.
